## Linux Macropad


I call my linux computer WaspBox, so I decided to make a complimentary macropad for my dev-workflow, however this is a learning process which I will document as I have never attempted to make a PCB board before. I will most likely make the buttons different keybinds to integrate in my [AwesomeWM](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome) workflow and my [text editor](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) setup.
