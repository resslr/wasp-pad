## 10/17/2025 3 PM - Initalized the Project  

To attempt this project I will fully document my learning process in a written notepad and thoroughly explain every GitHub commit. I hope by the end of this process to have succesfully learned how to create my own PCB board and learn the basics of electrical engineering and it's pairing with Computer Science.![j1.jpeg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjcxNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c72dd99aace49d878bb674dac0aa62662a9d106d/j1.jpeg)
  

## 10/17/2025 7:15 PM - Wired and Created the Schematics  

This was a lengthy process but I think it was an enlightening part of the learning curve. I personally enjoyed it and learned a lot, definetly boosting my confidence in working with the KiCad software. Now that the actual schematics are done I am going to work in the PCB Editor mode to get the PCB board modeled. As always the physical journal piece is attatched, I have also attatched the progress photo.![IMG_2204.JPG](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjgwNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4fce963dd6614c3c913c03209b5743370da5fe4c/IMG_2204.JPG)

## 10/17/2025 7:21 PM - Global Libraries Issue and How to Fix!  

When I was first creating the Schematics I noticed I had none of the default symbols, so to resolve this issue which you may encounter if you are trying to use the same software, here is what I did. (Arch Linux)

I installed the kicad-library-git AUR package and then went from Manage Symbol Libraries --> Folder Icon --> opened /usr/share/kicad/symbols/ and then selected every folder via CTRL+A, this sped up time and got all of the symbols in at once rather than manually importing, a step I highly recommend to be followed. I later encountered the same issue with footprints when they had to be assigned so to resolve the issue I took the same steps but with the footprint editor, which was only available in the main screen rather than being an option in the Preferences when the Schematic Editor is open. When you do the footprint step make sure to click the dropdown next to the folder and import the "KiCad (folder with *.kicad_mod files).![resolve.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjgwNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2b78be4436807596301f8cdacdf46a03c92c3750/resolve.png)
  

## 10/17/2025 10 PM - Routed the PCB  

I have completed the design of the PCB Board and the wiring, however there are some warnings from the Design Rules Checker (mostly clipped silkscreens), I will investigate these warnings and try to solve them. For now, to show progress I have attatched the photos of how it is progressing alongside my physical journal.

After investigation, I found that the errors were caused by the top part being outside of the main boundaries which is an intentional decision for the USB Port. The PCB design itself is now finished, the file will be uploaded accordingly to GitHub.
