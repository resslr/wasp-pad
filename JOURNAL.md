## 10/17/2025 - Initalized the Project  

To attempt this project I will fully document my learning process in a written notepad and thoroughly explain every GitHub commit. I hope by the end of this process to have succesfully learned how to create my own PCB board and learn the basics of electrical engineering and it's pairing with Computer Science.![j1.jpeg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjcxNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c72dd99aace49d878bb674dac0aa62662a9d106d/j1.jpeg)
